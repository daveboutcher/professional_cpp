title:  "Exercise 1 - Getting Started"
---

At the core of the exercises here is an application that does
graphics...specifically we will develop a card game.  The
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library is a an amazing cross platform,
open source library for doing graphics.  In this set of exercises we
will only be scratching the surface of what it can do.

The github repository contains an initial SDL application to display
images of the four suits in a standard deck of cards, along with the
images themselves and a makefile to build the application.

This exercise is either one of the easiest or one of the hardest
depending on your environment:
* Ensure you have a valid C++ compiler
* Install the SDL2 libraries
* Check the code out of github
* Build and run

Exercise 1 Objective
: Build and run the code on the master branch of the professional_cpp repository.

## C++ Compiler

Both Linux and macOS have C++ compilers available.  

These exercises have been tested on Ubuntu Linux 17.10 and macOS
10.13.  Google is your friend for installing the compilers, however on
macOS you will need to install XCode and its associated command line tools.
Since this is a programming tutorial, system support tutorial, you are
on your own to get C++ installed and working.

These exercises assume a C++17 compiler (the makefile included with
the exercises uses the "-std=c++1z" flag.)  Most of the exercises
should work with older versions of C++ as well.  These exercises
assume that you have the "make" program installed, however you can
learn all the C++ skills without having make.  You probably have it
though. 

## Install the SDL2 Libraries

These exercises make use of the core SDL2 library, and the SDL2-image
library.  Those need to be installed.  Note that there are two main
versions of SDL (1.2 and 2.0.)  These exercises make use of the SDL2
libraries.

On Ubuntu linux:
* sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev

On macOS, I highly recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  If
homebrew is installed:
* brew install sdl2 sdl2_image

You can also download the libraries from
[libsdl](https://www.libsdl.org/).  I don't personally recommend that,
since it will require getting messy with paths.

## Check the code out of github

Clone the master branch of the professional_cpp repository:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/daveboutcher/professional_cpp.git
~~~

You should now have a "professional_cpp" directory.  The start of
exercise 1 is the "master" branch (which should have been cloned by
default.)

## Build and run

Now for the exciting part.  If everything is set up correctly you
should be able to move to your new professional_cpp directry, type
"make" and then type "./main" and see something like the following:

![exercise1](  {{ "/assets/exercise1_screen.png" | absolute_url }} )

If you have problems, solving them is left as an exercise to the
student.  A phrase that you will often hear in a professional coding
environment is relevant at this point.

## Development Environments

A brief discussion on development environments...

There are a number of excellent C++ integrated development
environments (IDEs) that,
once they are mastered, can speed up the edit/compile/debug cycle.
Notable examples include:

* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/)

Editors include

* [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

Nothing in these exercises is dependent on any particular
environment, but it is well worth mastering at least one of them.  Do
not confuse mastery of an IDE, though, with mastery of a language.  I
would encourage you to use these exercises to additionally become more
proficient at a development environment.
