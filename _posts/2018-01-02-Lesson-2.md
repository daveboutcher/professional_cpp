Exercise 2 Objective
: Understand the existing SDL code

## Application logic

The SDL library has excellent [documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory), and lots of [tutorials](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials) both on the libsdl site, as well as elsewhere on the eb.

You can view the source code on [github](https://github.com/daveboutcher/professional_cpp/blob/master/cards.cpp), or in whatever development environment you are using.  The logic in our simple application is fairly straight forward:

1. Initialize the enviroment
~~~ c++
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
~~~

2. Create a 480x480 window in the center of the screen 
~~~ c++
// Create a window
SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("Cards",
                                      SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                      SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                      480, // Width
                                      480, // Height
                                      SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
~~~

3. Create a "renderer" for the window.  A renderer is the thing that turns bits into graphics. 
~~~ c++
// Create a renderer for the window
SDL_Renderer* renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1,
                                            SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);
~~~

4. Load images from files and turn them into an SDL *texture*
~~~ c++
SDL_Surface* club_surface = IMG_Load("club.png");
SDL_Texture* club_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer,
                                                         club_surface);
~~~

4. Get the height and width of the resulting texture (we'll need them later)
~~~ c++
int club_width, club_height;
SDL_QueryTexture(club_texture, nullptr, nullptr, &club_width, &club_height);
~~~

4. Loop getting "events" from the SDL library until we get one that tells us to quit.  There are lots of events we can get, but the only one we really care about right now is "quit"
~~~ c++
// This is the main SDL loop
while(true) {
    // Loop till we get told to quit
    SDL_Event event;
    SDL_PollEvent(&event);
    if(event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
        break;
    }
~~~

4. Clear the renderer
~~~ c++
// Clear the renderer
SDL_RenderClear(renderer);
~~~

5. Get the current window size
~~~ c++
// Get the window width
int window_width = 0;
SDL_GetWindowSize(window, &window_width, nullptr);
~~~                 

6. Figure out the padding between each image.
~~~ c++
// We are going to display 4 images, with padding between them and
// on the side...that works out to 5 blocks of padding
int padding = ((window_width -
				(club_width + diamond_width +
				 heart_width + spade_width))
			   / 5);
~~~

7. Work out where each image will be placed.  An SDL_Rect has x, y, width, and height fields.
In this case, the X position of the "diamond" image will be
the X position of the club image, plus the width of the club image, plus padding
~~~ c++
SDL_Rect diamond_pos = {padding + club_pos.x + club_pos.w, 10,
						diamond_width, diamond_height};
~~~

7. Copy each image onto the renderer at the position we calculated
~~~ c++
SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, club_texture, nullptr, &club_pos);
~~~

7. Actually display the renderer in the window
~~~ c++
SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
~~~

8. And finally we clean everything up
~~~ c++
// Clean up everything
SDL_DestroyTexture(club_texture);
SDL_FreeSurface(club_surface);
...    
SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
SDL_Quit();
~~~

## C++ Wrappers

It is very common to wrap C APIs into C++ objects, which can make them
both more expressive, as well as have better type safety and lifecycle
management.  For example, the current code does the following:

~~~ c++
SDL_Surface* heart_surface = IMG_Load("heart.png");
SDL_Texture* heart_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer,
                                                          heart_surface);

...

SDL_DestroyTexture(heart_texture);
SDL_FreeSurface(heart_surface);
~~~

meaning it is up to the user to the user to remember to free each of
the objects (surfaces, textures).  One of the features C++ has that C
does not is the concept of "destructors" that run when an object goes
out of scope.
