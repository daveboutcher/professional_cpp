title:  "Exercise 2 - Turning C into C++"
---

Our existing card application uses SDL2, which is a pure C library.
There are things we can do **better** in C++, particularly around
lifecycle management.

Exercise 2 Objective
: Wrap the C library with C++ objects

## Application logic

The logic is fairly straight forward:

1. Initialize the enviroment
~~~ c++
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
~~~

2. Create a 480x480 window in the center of the screen 
~~~ c++
int window_width = 480;
int window_height = 480;
// Create a window
SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("Cards",
                                      SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                      SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                      window_width,
                                      window_height,
                                      SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
~~~

3. Create a "renderer" for the window
~~~ c++
// Create a renderer for the window
SDL_Renderer* renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1,
                                            SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);
~~~

4. Load images from files and turn them into an SDL *texture*
~~~ c++
SDL_Surface* club_surface = IMG_Load("club.png");
SDL_Texture* club_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer,
                                                         club_surface);
~~~														 

5. We do some math to figure out where each of the four suits should
be displayed
~~~ c++
// We are going to display 4 images, with padding between them and
// on the side...that works out to 5 blocks of padding
int padding = (window_width - (card_width * 4)) / 5;
// Figure out everyone's positions
SDL_Rect club_pos =    {padding * 1 + card_width * 0, padding,
                        club_surface->w, club_surface->h};
~~~					

6. We add each image to the renderer at the x/y coordinates we just
calculated
~~~ c++
SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, club_texture, nullptr, &club_pos);
~~~

7. We display the resulting rendered image
~~~ c++
SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
~~~

8. And finally we clean everything up
~~~ c++
// Clean up everything
SDL_DestroyTexture(club_texture);
SDL_FreeSurface(club_surface);
...    
SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
SDL_Quit();
~~~

## C++ Wrappers

It is very common to wrap C APIs into C++ objects, which can make them
both more expressive, as well as have better type safety and lifecycle
management.  For example, the current code does the following:

~~~ c++
SDL_Surface* heart_surface = IMG_Load("heart.png");
SDL_Texture* heart_texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer,
                                                          heart_surface);

...

SDL_DestroyTexture(heart_texture);
SDL_FreeSurface(heart_surface);
~~~

meaning it is up to the user to the user to remember to free each of
the objects (surfaces, textures).  One of the features C++ has that C
does not is the concept of "destructors" that run when an object goes
out of scope.
