Exercise 3 Objective
: Create C++ objects around the SDL API
</div>

## C++ Wrappers

It is very common to wrap C APIs into C++ objects, which can make them
both more expressive, as well as have better type safety and lifecycle
management.  For example, the current code does the following:

~~~ c++
SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("Cards", ...)
SDL_Renderer* renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);

...

SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
~~~

Two objects are created and pointers returned...and later must be
destroyed in the correct order.  One of the features C++ has that C
does not is the concept of "destructors" that run when an object goes
out of scope.

In this exercise, `cards.cpp` has been rewritten to make use of C++
classes.

~~~ c++
#include "cdl/window.h"
#include "cdl/surface.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Initialize SDL
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

    try {

        cdl::Window window = cdl::Window("Cards",
                                         cdl::position{SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED},
                                         cdl::size{480, 480});

        cdl::Renderer renderer = window.createRenderer();
        
        // Load the four images
        cdl::Surface club_surface = cdl::Surface("club.png");
        cdl::Texture club_texture = renderer.createTexture(club_surface);
        
        cdl::Surface diamond_surface = cdl::Surface("diamond.png");
        cdl::Texture diamond_texture = renderer.createTexture(diamond_surface);
        
        cdl::Surface heart_surface = cdl::Surface("heart.png");
        cdl::Texture heart_texture = renderer.createTexture(heart_surface);
        
        cdl::Surface spade_surface = cdl::Surface("spade.png");
        cdl::Texture spade_texture = renderer.createTexture(spade_surface);
        
        // This is the main SDL loop
        while(cdl::running()) {

            renderer.clear();

            // Get the window width
            int window_width = window.width();
            
            // We are going to display 4 images, with padding between them and
            // on the side...that works out to 5 blocks of padding
            int padding = ((window_width -
                            (club_texture.size().width + diamond_texture.size().width +
                             heart_texture.size().width + spade_texture.size().width))
                           / 5);
            
            int currentX = padding;
            
            renderer.add(club_texture, cdl::position{currentX, 10});
            currentX += club_texture.size().width + padding;
            
            renderer.add(diamond_texture, cdl::position{currentX, 10});
            currentX += diamond_texture.size().width + padding;
            
            renderer.add(heart_texture, cdl::position{currentX, 10});
            currentX += heart_texture.size().width + padding;
            
            renderer.add(spade_texture, cdl::position{currentX, 10});
            currentX += spade_texture.size().width + padding;

            renderer.display();
        }
    } catch (const cdl::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    SDL_Quit();
    return 0;
}

Your goal is to implement all the classes and header files, such as
the `cdl::Window` class defined in the `cdl/window.h` header file.
You should check out the *Exercise2-start* branch, which contains the
`cards.cpp` file and provide everything required to make the file
compile.  **You should not have to modify the `cards.cpp` file in any
way**

You should write **destructors** for your classes that call the
appropriate SDL_Destroy functions.

A working solution is in the Exercise2-solution branch, howeve I
strongly encourage you to come up with a working solution on your own
using resources such as [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

**Note:** If your program crashes, pay particular attention to whether
  you are passing any object by *value* (i.e. copying them) or by *reference*.

## Coding Standards

Most organizations, be they companies or open source projects, have
coding standards.  Coding standards help greatly when code is modified
by multiple developers.  For this set of exercises we will follow the [Google C++ coding
standard](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), though
we do use C++ exceptions, which they do not allow.

As an example, when we create a "Window" class, we will put it in the
"cdl" namespace ("cdl" being our namespace for C++ SDL) and put it in
the header file "cdl/window.h".

Some specific guildelines used here:

* With few exceptions, place code in a namespace. Do not use
  using-directives (e.g. using namespace foo).
* The naming convention for member variables of a class is to add a
  "_" suffix...for example `int foo_`.
* Classes are stored in a header file with the name of the class, and
  the directory structure follows the namespace.  In our case the
  `cdl::Window` class

You don't want to try and read the coding standards front to
back...these exercises 
are supposed to be fun, and is not anyone's definition of fun.  But I
have tried to use them consistently, and they are typical of the kind
of coding standards used in the real world....and that you will get
complaints about in your code reviews if you violate.
