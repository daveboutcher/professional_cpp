# Introduction

I am professional C++ programmer...I get paid to write C++ code.  And
we hire C++ programmers, many of them right out of college, listing
C++ as a proficiency on their CV.  Many of them have used C++ in a
*Datastructures and Algorithms* class, and have a basic understanding
of the differences between a
[std::map](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map) and
a
[std::unordered_map](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map).
